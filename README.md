# Coding Culture 2018
We are team of developers from VIT, Vellore. Through our interactions with the various participating organisations, we understood their requirements and areas in which cutting edge technology can be used to make the most of available resources. 

Our first module is for tracking and understanding the demographics of visitors to the museum. The second module is a knowledge platform. The Iris platform is a forum for conservationists to interact within the community. And the final module, Visitor Engagement Android app is for an immersive in-museum experience. 

## Museum Analytics

### Description
Using the existing infrastructure, we propose to mine data through CCTV cameras to understand the visitor footfall and also their flow during their visit to the museum. Through the interactive graphs that we built, museums could monitor the areas which are receiving a greater exposure and co-relate it with environmental readings from the sensors placed throughout the museum to take necessary precautions to conserve the exhibits. 

### Motivation
There are numerous data sources in a museum that give insights into obscure areas. Through the personal interactions with the participating museums we realised that manifesting all the raw data through interactive graphs, we could help them in locating points of interest. From this prototype, we would like to give a glimpse of the possible. 

### Technical details
Platform - Web<br>
Languages  - JavaScript, Python<br>
Frameworks used - D3.JS (JS), OpenCV, Tensorflow, Tornado<br>
This is a web application. We are visualising the footfalls through the D3.JS from a CSV file containing all the footfall information in JavaScript. The website is completely responsive and scales on devices of all resolutions. Using OpenCV we sample a frame every 30 seconds from the given CCTV footage. Using the Single Shot Detector trained on the MS-COCO dataset using Tensorflow, we tweaked it to detect only people from a given frame. Once the entire video is annotated, we return the data in form of JSON for plotting a line graph to understand the trends. The JSON data is visualised using D3.JS

## Visitor Engagement
### Description
While on a trip to the museum we observed that there are limited ways to explore further about a particular art piece. We alleviate this through a companion android application for the museum. If a visitor is interested in a particular exhibit, a simple scan on the name tag will present the user with the relevant Wikipedia articles. In addition to this using style transfer, the visitor can create a version of themselves into any of the paintings that are on exhibit at the museum. 
### Motivation
During our visit to the CSMVS museum, at India in Nine stories exhibit, we wanted to know more about a particular exhibit but could not do so. So we wanted to build a system that would involve the least effort from the user end and give the most information about an exhibit. 

### Technical details
Platform - Android application<br>
Languages - Android, Python, Frameworks used - Volley (Android), Fresco (Android), GSON (Android), Google Cloud Vision API, PyTorch (Python)<br>
Using the Google Cloud Vision API, we are parsing the text that is on the name tag of an exhibit and then returning the relevant wikipedia articles. For style transfer, we are using the features generated by the CNN for both the style and content image. Then through a loss function, we are training a model to transfer features from the style to the content image.

## Forum - Iris Knowledge Platform
### Description
A community is often better than an individual at solving issues. Sharing and discussing ideas is the cornerstone for innovation. If you have a question about conservation, through the IRIS platform you can interact with conservationists and art enthusiasts from around the world. This could not only benefit you but the entire community as well. This is a repository of information. 

### Motivation
Currently there is a dearth in communities catering specifically to art conservation. The most popular option is a reddit subthread /r/ArtConservation.  Building this platform for conservationists could bring in diverse perceptions to a problem thus helping in growing the community.

### Technical details
Platform - Web<br>
Languages - Ruby on Rails<br>
Frameworks - Discourse<br>
We are using the discourse platform to create this forum. <br>
