# [Team Iris](https://team-iris.me)
This is our submission for the [Coding Culture Hackathon](https://coding-culture.zkm.de)

# Coding Culture 2018
We are team of developers from VIT, Vellore. Through our interactions with the various participating organisations, we understood their requirements and areas in which cutting edge technology can be used to make the most of available resources. 

Our first module is for tracking and understanding the demographics of visitors to the museum. The second module is a knowledge platform. The Iris platform is a forum for conservationists to interact within the community. And the final module, Visitor Engagement Android app is for an immersive in-museum experience.
